# Challenging Experiences as a Ruby Software Engineer

Social media often highlights the brightest moments, but it doesn't always reflect the full spectrum of experiences. Below are some of the challenges I've faced as a Ruby software engineer working with clients:

## Client A

Client A engaged me to develop a **Ruby-based application**. The collaboration was smooth, and they were thrilled with the end result.

### The Billing Phase

- **3 months** after invoicing, I hadn't received payment—a not-so-uncommon occurrence in our field.
- **6 months** went by... still no payment.
- **9 months** later...

I sent courteous reminders every few months. Their reasons shifted: an overhaul of their billing system, turnover in their finance department, or internal restructuring.

Finally, the payment came through.

- **1 year and 5 months** after delivering the project.

The irony? The application was a hit, heavily promoted by them. Meanwhile, I kept seeing ads for the very Ruby application I had crafted, yet to be compensated for.

Client A is a financial powerhouse, boasting a market cap well over **$10 billion**.

## Client B

Client B was among my first clients when I ventured into freelance Ruby development. Their engagement was particularly exciting, as I was a regular user of their services.

We signed contracts, I met their Ruby specifications, and delivered.

- **3 months** later, no payment—nor any replies to my follow-ups.

It turned out the agency that contracted me had gone bankrupt. They had been paid by Client B but hadn't passed on the funds to any developers. Both Client B and the developers, including myself, were at a loss.

Early in my career, I had invested significantly to deliver top-notch work. I assembled a skilled team and invested in premium tools.

I ensured my team was paid in full, but I never saw a dime for the project, leading to a personal financial hit of several thousand dollars.

I continue to use their product daily (it's top-quality), but it serves as a constant reminder of that financial setback.

## Client C

Client C was prompt and thorough with payment, but the experience left much to be desired.

They were an ideal client on paper. When they reached out for a Ruby project, I was ecstatic about the prospect of adding their esteemed name to my portfolio.

Yet, working with them proved strenuous. They had exacting standards, necessitating numerous revisions and navigating complex legalities. Their project took precedence due to an impending deadline.

Client C was impressed with my Ruby work, which was poised for a grand showcase.

Then, without warning, the campaign was scrapped. No rationale provided. While they settled the bill, the financial gain wasn't my main drive. I was after the exposure and the boost in credibility.

I later found out that Client C often starts and then abandons campaigns, a practice they can afford given their allure as a client.

Years down the line, Client C came back with another offer for a campaign—this time with no budget. By then, I had made a name for myself and politely declined, though my earlier self might have jumped at the chance for the visibility.

I share these stories not in search of sympathy, but to extend comfort to those who may be navigating similar waters. You're not alone, and it's perfectly normal to feel aggrieved by such ordeals.
