## Challenging Experiences as a Ruby Software Engineer

*Just a bit ago...*

We often hear about the wins in tech. I want to share some tough bits.

Three times when working with clients was tricky...

## 1. Partner Alpha

**Partner Alpha** asked me to do a Ruby project. They were kind, liked my ideas, and all went well. I finished the app, and they were chuffed.

But then it was time to pay...

- **Three months after billing**—no dosh (it's not rare).
- **Six months**... still nothing (sadly, it happens).
- **Nine months later**...

I kept sending polite nudges every so often. They had all sorts of excuses: a new billing system, the payment person had left, or company changes.

At last, I got paid—one year and five months after I was done.

The app did great for them—they even spent loads on ads for it. All that time, I saw ads for my own work, wondering if I'd ever see the money.

Just so you know, Partner Alpha is loaded; they're worth over £10 billion.

## 2. Firm Beta

**Firm Beta** was one of my first gigs when I started freelancing. I was over the moon when they got in touch—I loved their product and used it all the time.

I got the contract sorted, got the thumbs up for my work, and I shared it.

Three months without a penny, and they ghosted my emails. Odd, that.

Turned out, the agency that hired me had gone bust. They nicked the money from Firm Beta, ran out of cash, and didn't pay any of us.

Early in my career, I'd splashed out to make this project top-notch. I'd forked out loads for a pro team and kit to ensure the quality was ace.

I'd paid my team fair and square, but I ended up out of pocket big time.

I still use their product. It's cracking, but it's a daily nudge of the cash I lost.

## 3. Enterprise Gamma

**Enterprise Gamma** paid up quick and in full, but this one was gutting.

Gamma was the dream. A few years back, when I was just starting, they got in touch. Their email was a shocker. Me? They wanted me? The buzz and validation were unreal.

But Gamma was tough as nails. They were dead specific about what they wanted. I jumped through many legal loopholes and redid my work loads to get it right. It was a manic time, and I put off other stuff to make it happen.

They were made up with my work. I was buzzing. My work would be seen by millions.

Then the email came:

They'd canned the whole thing. My work, and everyone else's, wouldn't get used. No reason why. They'd pay us, but it wasn't about the money. They're known for paying peanuts because everyone's desperate to work with them.

I was gutted. I'd given it my all, thinking it would be a game-changer.

I found out later it's normal for Gamma. They start loads of projects, pick what they like, and drop the rest.

Years later, Gamma came back for more. Another project. A video to big up their product on their site.

The budget? Zilch. One of the richest companies out there, wanting free work for a bit of limelight.

This time, I said no.

I'd made a name for myself enough to turn it down. But I felt for the old me—the keen bean—who would've said yes, needing the break.

*I'd love to tell you who they are, but I've got to keep schtum because of NDAs and not wanting a fuss.*

*I'm not after sympathy. I'm lucky to do what I love, and most clients are sound.*

*But these things happened when I was just a newbie. I felt on my own and out of luck. If you're in tech and this sounds familiar, you're not on your own.*
